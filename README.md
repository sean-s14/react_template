git remote remove origin  # rm -rf .git may render this useless
rm -rf .git
git init
git branch -M main
npm install
npm start
```

- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

Using upper case first letters for file names seems to cause a build failure on Netfliy
To remedy, execute `git config core.ignorecase false` before pushing to github
